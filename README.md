This notebook demonstrates how to build a **sentiment analysis** pipeline to classify Amazon product reviews as **positive** or **negative**. It uses machine learning/NLP techniques to understand customer feedback and gauge overall satisfaction.

---

### 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Amazon product reviews (binary sentiment: Positive / Negative)
- **Task**: Text classification
- **Goal**: Predict sentiment of a review using NLP models
- **Approach**: Preprocessing → Vectorization → Model Training → Evaluation

### 🛠️ Requirements

```bash
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib
seaborn
wordcloud
```

Install with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```

---

### 🚀 Sample Inference

```python
review = "This product exceeded my expectations!"
prediction = model.predict(vectorizer.transform([review]))
print("Sentiment:", "Positive" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Negative")
```

### 📌 Notes

- You can extend this model using:
  - Deep learning models (LSTM, BERT, etc.)
  - Multiclass sentiment (e.g., star ratings)
  - Topic modeling or aspect-based sentiment analysis
- This is a great base for e-commerce analytics or review summarization.
